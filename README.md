# CRF - Check Repeated Files
## 
 
This gem finds exact duplicate files inside a given directory and all sub directories. The result of the execution gets stored in a file called crf_log.txt. The execution time depends on the amount of files and each size, so be careful (or patient). You have options to run an approximated version of the algorithm which is faster but more inaccurate.

## Usage

Using CRF is very simple. Just execute it passing the path of the directory you want to look for duplicates.
